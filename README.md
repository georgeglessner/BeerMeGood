## Contributing

This project uses [The Beer Mapping Project](https://beermapping.com) to pull the information for breweries. If you find that your city does not have any listing, you can create an account on the website and [add a location](https://beermapping.com/addlocation/), or add a new entry to the [Brewery List](https://github.com/georgeglessner/BreweryLocator/blob/master/breweryList.txt) to have me add it in for you.
